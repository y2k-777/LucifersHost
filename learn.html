                    <h2>How to stop pedos:</h2>
                    <p>This is our small guide on avoiding predators online, stay safe and avoid getting sucked into the nightmare's they bring...<br></p>
                    <h3>The 5 things to remember:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Don't be an idiot and trust everyone. Keep an eye on your kids, make sure they understand the dangers and educate them about the world's filth.</li> <br>
                        <li>Online predators are a thing, so make sure your children know the basics of online safety. Block all the fucking social media accounts that look suspicious.</li> <br>
                        <li>Avoid anyone who seems overly interested in children. These sick fucks often groom both children and parents, so be a judge of character for once.</li> <br>
                        <li>Report any suspicious behavior to the authorities. Don't hesitate, because those pedos could be planning something way worse.</li> <br>
                        <li>Don't be afraid to be rude and confrontational. Teach your kids to run away and scream their lungs out if anyone tries to grab them.</li> <br>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>How to avoid retardism:</h2>
                    <p>Anyone reading this, your here for a reason. Your either here because you enjoy what we do, or your the target of Lucifers Host... You may be thinking; how do I suck-less? Here is a quick guide for you.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep your toxic opinions to yourself. We don't need to hear your backward thoughts on race, religion, or politics</li> <br>
                        <li>Don't pretend to be something you're not. Everyone has insecurities, but some people online act like they're God's gift to the internet. Newsflash: You're not a hacktivist, a tech guru, or a professional shitposter. I don't claim to be anything, neither should you.</li> <br>
                        <li>Learn how to debate properly. No one cares about your shitty arguments or how smart you think you are. Understand the art of discussion and when to concede a point.</li> <br>
                        <li>Respect boundaries. Some people don't want to talk to you, and that's fine. Leave them alone and move on. Stalking people online is weird and creepy.</li> <br>
                        <li>Understand the difference between constructive criticism and being a dick. You're not helping anyone by being overly negative or dismissive.</li> <br>
                        <li>Refrain from trolling. It's not funny, it's not original, and it makes you look like a bitter loser.</li> <br>
                    </ul>
